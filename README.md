# UCSD-SampleCode

These are the code stacks from UCSD's online course on coursera, the first online programming course I ever took.

It first taught me the basic of concept and several how-to about Object Oriented Programming.
Then it gave me a good understanding of algorithmic efficiency, which I believe is one of the most important elements in the CS field.
It concluded with a capstone project, for which I implemented several methods in the graph theory, such as SCC and Egonet,
to analyze social media network, using Facebook account data.
